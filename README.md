# 👨‍🔬 vat-reader

An experimental reader prototype for [Value-Added Text](https://github.com/seetee-io/value-enabled-text).

## How to Run

This prototype uses [React Native](https://reactnative.dev).
Have a look at [_Setting up the Development Environment_](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for how to get stup developing with React Native.

**⚠️ Prerequisite:** The protoype needs [`vat-api`](https://github.com/seetee-io/vat-api) running on `localhost:3000`.

Once setup, run:

- `npx react-native start` to start the JS bundler; and in a separate terminal
- `npx react-native run-ios`; or
- `npx react-native run-android` to start the application
